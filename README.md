# Event-Scheduler
This is a mini project designed with python only. It uses pygame and datetime module only. This project is simple command/console based i.e. it does not contain any GUI. In this project you can add events to be reminder along with the time in which you want the reminder to remind to you. Also after every alarm it will give you the option to check the activity log, quit the reminder and continue to next reminds as well. After every alarm you have to give the reminder a specified input to stop the alarm otherwise it will continue ringing and at this instance the time for you next reminder will be continue, Hence not giving the input will not affect your next reminder.
